### Pet ResQ: An App Connecting Stray Animals to Loving Homes
#### Design of an app using Figma
 Every day on my way to university, I encounter stray dogs and cats struggling to survive in the harsh urban environment.

 Some are malnourished, others show signs of illness, and a few have visible injuries. This heartbreaking sight always makes me think, "What if there was a way to connect these strays with families or individuals who'd love to adopt or help them?"
 
 One day, as I am discussing this with my friend at a cafe, we think of creating a web application that bridges the gap between these helpless animals and prospective pet owners or kind-hearted individuals who may be willing to adopt them.
 
 We decided to reach out to local animal shelters, pet shops, and vet clinics to support the initiative. These stakeholders commit to promoting the app and providing necessary medical care for the strays before they are adopted.

### Features of the "Pet ResQ" App:

- User Registration and Login:
Users can register and log in to participate in the initiative, either as someone who's reporting a stray or someone looking to adopt.

- Report a Stray:
Users can add details about a stray animal they've encountered. Details would include the animal's location, pictures, any visible signs of illness or injury, and the date and time of the sighting.

- Adoption Listings:
Users can browse through the list of strays available for adoption. Each listing provides all details about the animal and the contact information of the person who reported it.

- Adoption Process:
If someone is interested in adopting a stray, they can initiate the adoption process through the app, which involves a brief screening to ensure the safety and well-being of the animal.

- User's Dashboard:
Users can see the list of strays they've reported or adopted. They can update details, delete posts, or mark an animal as 'adopted'

- Partner Listings:
Veterinary clinics, pet shops, and shelters can register as partners. Their services and contact information will be listed for users who need medical care for the strays or want to buy necessary supplies.
